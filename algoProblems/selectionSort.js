/**
 * I want to a sorted version of an array using selection sort.
 * The sorted array should have the lowest value first, and the highest value last.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Solve the problem before writing the code. Write your pseudocode here.**
 * 
 * We're going to make two sublists in this array,
 * one will be the unsorted sublist,
 * one will be the sorted sublist.
 * 
 * As the sorted sublist grows, the unsorted sublist will shrink,
 * until the entire list becomes one sorted list.
