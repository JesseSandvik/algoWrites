/**
 * Implement a recursive factorial function.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * **Solve the problem before writing the code. Write your pseudocode here.**
 * 
 *  This problem is solved as an example of a recursive function.
 *  Recursion is a problem-solving method that involves a function calling itself.
 *  Think of recursion as a way to solve a smaller version
 *  of a potentially much larger problem you're trying to solve.
 *  
 * *Note of caution when using recursion*
 * 
 *  Because recursion is a problem-solving method that repeatedly calls itself,
 *  it can be very easy to write a function incorrectly that results in an infinite loop.
 *  Remember to establish a base case before running your code.
